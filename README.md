👋 Hi, I’m Bhagya

I like learning new technologies by building small projects and experimenting with them.  
I’m interested in exploring different areas of software development and understanding how things work under the hood.

🌱 Currently learning and working with:
- Java and Spring Boot
- Automation and testing tools
- Linux and scripting
- Cloud and platform concepts

💞️ Open to collaborating on projects where I can learn, build, or experiment with new ideas.

⚡ Fun fact: I often understand technical concepts by turning them into little stories in my head 🙂
